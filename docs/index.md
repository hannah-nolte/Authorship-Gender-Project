# Why investigate authorship in PLOS ONE?

# Ethics 
This project has some inherent ethical considerations. Due to the use of an API to estimate the gender of published authors, this project inherently produced a gender dichotomy that is not reflective of the true gender spectrum. The API may also have assigned a gender that misaligns with the authors actual gender identification. Further, to ensure that we were able to retain the maximum number of articles in the dataset, the exclusion criteria was the average probability for each paper, rather than the individual probability for each author. This would have inherently led to predictions with lower probability being included in the dataset when other authors in the same paper had higher associated probabilities. 

Additionally, when estimating nationality, the API may have assigned a country code to an author with which the author does not identify with. This misalignment is exacerbated because the API produced a low accuracy for estimated nationality. Moreover, the API is unable to account for multiple ethnic identities or immigration status when predicting nationality. Lastly, the age predicted by the API is unlikely to match the actual age of the author and the accuracy of the estimates was not provided by the API. Hence, while this information is valuable, limited generalizable conclusions should be drawn from these results, especially for the nationality and age data.

# Data

To get our dataset, we first obtained the XML file from PLOS ONE's website which contains all published papers between 2006 and 2019. Due to the absence of the discipline field in the XML files after 2012, only papers published betweeen 2006 and 2012 were considered

# Methodology
Both appropriate statistical methods and machine learning techniques were used to analyze the data of interest. 
- To quantify the gender representation for each paper, a metric where each author on a paper is assigned either 0 or 1 based on their gender (male = 0, female = 1) was used. These assigned values were then summed and divided over the total number of authors of the paper.  
- The abstracts were analyzed using the 2015 version of the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count software (LIWC; Pennebaker et al., 2015), which is a natural language text processing module. Words within the input text document are compared to LIWC's validated dictionaries indicating ~90 psychometric properties. 
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to test if the high dimensional output generated by LIWC could be represented using an underlying set of components. 
- K-means clustering using the PCA components was used to determine if the articles could be classified into certain clusters. These clusters could then be compared to the demographic variables such as gender and ethnicity representation scores to investigate if demographic composition of authors influenced their writing style.
- The Lasso regression was used to investigate if there was a relationship between the linguistic properties of the paper abstracts and the representation score for the authors of the paper. The Lasso regression was picked to isolate the most relevant parameters of interest that contribute to the gender representation in publication.
